# YelpCamp 

The purpose of this Yelp Camp project was to understand the fundamentals of full stack web development. Yelp Camp has similar functionality of Yelp where 
a user can add a campground, or campgrounds, and add comments to their own added campground, as well as other userâ€™s campgrounds. They are only authorized 
to perform these mentioned actions if they are a registered user. Please see below the user experience from someone who is not logged in vs someone who is logged in.
